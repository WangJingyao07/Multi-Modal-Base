Ses02F_script01_3_M031.mp4 [split|sign] Then I came back and it was incredible.  There was no meaning in it here.  The whole thing to them seemed like sort of a bus accident.  I went to work with Dad and that rat race again. [split|sign] Sad
Ses03F_script03_2_M001.mp4 [split|sign] I knew nothing of the sort. You took presents from him. [split|sign] Angry

Ses05M_script01_1_F026.mp4 [split|sign] Well, the trouble is you never saw enough women. [split|sign] Neutral
Ses01M_script01_1_F030.mp4 [split|sign] That's a good answer but it doesn't answer anything.  You haven't seen her since you went away to war, it's been five years. [split|sign] Angry
Ses05M_script03_2_M020.mp4 [split|sign] It's a pity you didn't have a little bit more brandy.  It might have made you a little less disagreeable. [split|sign] Angry
Ses05F_script03_2_F020.mp4 [split|sign] They sting. [split|sign] Angry

Ses05M_impro05_M001.mp4 [split|sign] So, um, what do I do? [split|sign] Neutral
Ses04F_script03_1_M031.mp4 [split|sign] The worst one was in Cannes when your curling irons burnt holes in my dressing gown. [split|sign] Neutral

Ses04F_impro07_M018.mp4 [split|sign] Seriously, what's your major? [split|sign] Neutral
Ses04M_script02_1_M001.mp4 [split|sign] Actually, I wanted to go a little farther up the coast, get away from the lights and the people, but I was afraid we'd miss it.  How you doing? [split|sign] Happy
